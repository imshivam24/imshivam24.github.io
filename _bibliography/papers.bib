abstract="The viscosity of nanofluids can be influenced by many physical factors so it is difficult to obtain an accurate prediction model using only traditional theoretical model-driven methods or data-driven black-box models. This study proposes a modern approach named Physics Guided Deep Neural Network (PGDNN) for viscosity prediction that combines the data-driven models and physics-based theoretical models to achieve their complementary strengths and develop the modeling of physical processes. This PGDNN model is applied with a large number of data points (9000 data points) containing both experimental and simulated data of spherical nanoparticles Al2O3, CuO, SiO2, and TiO2. Further, this technique overcomes the overfitting issue and performs better than other traditional models while predicting unseen data. As far as we know, the PGDNN model is novel and not even used earlier to predict the viscosity of nanofluids. The learning performance of the proposed model is analyzed using different statistical performance indicators and Bayesian optimization is used for hyper-parameter tuning. Then, epistemic uncertainty quantification is performed to estimate the confidence level of the proposed model. Our PGDNN model outperformed various previous theoretical and computer-aided models with ùëÖ2=0.9961 and RMSE‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.0312. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis is performed and the results show that the volume fraction of particle is the most and viscosity of a base fluid is the second most significant parameters to determine the viscosity of nanofluids.",

abstract="
Heterogeneous catalytic pathways for clean energy conversion involve thousands of elementary steps, but most quantum-mechanical models involve only a few dozen reactions. We combine extensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations, machine learning (ML) for activation barrier prediction, and human intelligence-inspired reaction enumeration and elementary reaction identification. This enables automated kinetic modeling of CO2 hydrogenation on copper, a key process to produce fuels and chemicals. We construct the largest dataset of 152 elementary CO2 reduction reactions and experimentally determine CO2 conversion, finding that even large networks with 100+ reactions are insufficient. In contrast, our approach reveals 9389 elementary reactions, reducing human bias in the reaction pathway. We unravel 40-fold higher CO2 conversion rates, following experimental trends of methanol and CO production. We establish the crucial role of intermolecular hydrogen transfer and hydrogenation by molecular hydrogen, a surprising ML-enabled discovery validated post-facto. The proposed strategy to comprehensively model complex catalytic mechanisms will significantly advance catalysis research and carbon conversion processes.",

Designing catalyst materials for the electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) requires an understanding of the underlying thermodynamics and kinetics. In this review, we discuss the characteristics of two-dimensional (2D) and bulk materials, which distinguish their catalytic properties. We map catalyst performance in the faradaic efficiency‚Äìapplied potential space for various hydrocarbons and oxygenates on these catalyst classes. We explain different approaches for modeling catalytic CO2RR, such as the computational hydrogen electrode, grand canonical (GC) potential kinetics, and GC density functional theory, with the lattermost accurately capturing potential-dependent kinetics. We review recent attempts made to break scaling relationships between intermediate adsorption energies and describe unique features found in 2D materials. Finally, we compare kinetics on both material classes using microkinetic modeling. We conclude that future studies should focus on realistic simulations of the electrode‚Äìelectrolyte interface and combining the favorable properties of 2D and bulk materials to engineer high-performance CO2RR catalysts.",

Electrochemical processes, such as water splitting and carbon dioxide/monoxide (CO(2)) reduction, will play a prominent role in the ongoing quest for mitigating climate change. For such reactions, microkinetic modeling (MKM) is a valuable tool to relate electrolyzer operating conditions, such as pH, temperature, and pressure, to current densities and faradaic efficiencies. However, previous studies have solely focused on steady-state modeling of electrochemical kinetics. Here, we perform unsteady-state MKM (USS-MKM) with and without potential sweeping to capture transient dynamics and realistically model reaction kinetics. Our analysis demonstrates that sweeping leads to accurate description of the dynamics of current-potential relationships that arise during experimental linear sweep voltammetry or staircase voltammetry measurements. The proposed approach is validated using CO reduction and oxygen evolution reactions, where good agreement is observed between our long-time USS-MKM results and previously reported steady-state MKM data. We also show that our approach leads to excellent agreement with experimental CO reduction current density data. Moreover, our proposed approach is automated, scaling to large reaction mechanisms, and enables a graphical representation of electrochemical reaction networks. Overall, by enabling USS-MKM with potential sweeping, our framework simplifies the study of complex electrocatalytic mechanisms and offers valuable insights into their operation under dynamic conditions.",
